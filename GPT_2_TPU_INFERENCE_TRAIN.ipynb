This question came from someone who had recently started talking about how the U.S. dollar has been outperforming other currencies since 2008. The answer to this question is not easy to explain without going into detail about what exactly it means to \"underperform.\" It might also seem counterintuitive to suggest that a currency with high purchasing power should perform well, but there are some very strong reasons why this is true.\n",

            "I am going to try to give you a brief overview of the most important factors that contribute to a country's ability to outperform its peers when it comes to foreign exchange markets. These factors will help explain why the United States has done so well in terms of trading with other countries over the past decade or two.\n",

            "\n",
            "First, let's talk about the economy. When it comes to economic performance, we tend to think of the economy as being driven by GDP growth. However, the U.S. economy is actually more than just GDP. In fact, the U.S. government reports that the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) accounts for only 20% of total U.S. exports. The rest of the value added goes towards services, which include everything from health care to education to transportation. So while GDP does account for a large portion of the overall output, it doesn't tell us all that much about how well a country performs relative to the rest of the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another way to look at the economy is through the lens of \"output per worker,\" which refers to the amount of goods and services produced by each individual worker. If we compare the average annual earnings of workers in the United States to those of workers in other major economies, we find that the U.S. labor market is quite competitive. For example, the median wage of a full-time, year-round employee in the United States is $26,000 per year. Compare that to the $21,500 earned by a similar worker in Japan, where the average worker earns $13,200 annually.\n",

The first blade is called the \"blade\", and the second blade is called the \"razor\". This is the definition given in the Wikipedia article on \"Razor\":\n",

            "So, if you want to use a razor for slicing, you need to hold the knife at a right angle to your body. If you don't know how to do that, then here is some advice from my friend, Dr. David M. Bowers. He is a board-certified orthopedic surgeon who specializes in treating patients with injuries to their hands, feet, and lower extremities. Here is his advice on using a razor for cutting meat:\n",
